        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Marinate the prawns in the chipotle paste.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat some oil in a pot on a medium heat. Saute the onions or shallots in a pot until soft 
                and then add the chilli and garlic and let them cook for a further 3 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the tomato paste to the pot and cover the onion, chilli and garlic. After this add the 
                fresh tomatoes to the pot and allow them to break down into a sauce. Allow this sauce to simmer 
                for a few minutes. Add white wine and cook until reduced.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a separate pan, bring water to a boil and add the linguine. Follow the package instructions 
                to cook the pasta until it is al dente.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once the pasta is al dente, add to the sauce and mix. Do this for a few minutes until pasta is 
                fully cooked. After 2 minutes serve and enjoy.
