            Everyone needs a great, go-to pasta dish that they can turn to in a pinch. For me, I love pasta
            far too much to pick just one, so I have 2. My second choice would be a Spaghetti Carbonara. 
            Carbonara is perhaps the essential pasta dish, beautiful and creamy, you too can recreate this 
            Italian classic if you follow this recipe!

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Giuncale</li>
            <li>Pecorino Romano</li>
            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Black Pepper</li>
            <li>Spaghetti</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Grate the Pecorino Romano into a bowl, and crack in the egg yolks and mix until it forms a paste. Aim for one egg yolk per serving 
                and then half that number for the egg whites. (So for 4 people, use 2 full eggs and 2 more yolks.)
            </li>
            <li>
                Add your giuncale to a pan to a low heat a first. You want to render the fat out to begin with. Once 
                you can see that most of the fat has been rendered and is in the pan, turn the heat up to high and cook 
                the giuncale until crispy.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a separate pan, bring water to a boil and add the spaghetti. Follow the package instructions 
                to cook the pasta until it is al dente. Save some pasta water when you drain the pasta.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once the pasta is al dente, add the egg and cheese paste to the giuncale, and then quickly add the 
                spaghetti and the saved up pasta water to the pan. Mix the pasta and the paste together until the sauce 
                has no lumps and looks creamy. After this serve
            </li>
            <li>
                Once served, add plenty of black pepper and pecorino romano. Then enjoy!
